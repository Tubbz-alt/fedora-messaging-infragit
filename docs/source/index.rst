Welcome to fedora-messaging-infragit's documentation!
=====================================================

This project defines `fedora-messages`_ sent when `Fedora`_ contributors push commits to the Fedora
Infrastructure `Ansible repository`_.

Included in this library are the message schema for those messages, and a handy Python class that
can be used to send and receive those messages.
